          <p>
            I love making a plan, solving problems/issues and creating something meaningful. 
            This is why I started my career as a civil engineer, which gave me a lot of opportunities to conduct academic researches and to participate in construction projects for a better future. 
            These projects usually took from a year to several years and threw me a lot of tough problems but solving them by working with other team members using engineering and project management skills was a thrilling challenge for me and I had great experience with them. 
            It also gave me a chance to work in an international environment and this is when I realized that working in a diverse environment was what I would like for the rest of my career and it encouraged me to move to Canada.<br><br>
            
            The last five years, I worked for or at Twitter to keep the online platform safe for everyone. 
            My main focus was on analyzing safety and misinformation related data and managing programs and projects. 
            As a large international tech company, Twitter had many on-going programs and projects at the same time and working in such a fast pace was not easy. 
            However, this gave me a chance to develop my project management skills and learn how to solve issues by working with different departments. 
            During my career with Twitter, I also developed my data analytic skills by taking a Python Data Science bootcamp course and by using SQL and Google App Script in the daily works.<br><br>
            
            Currently I'm taking a full stack developer bootcamp so that I can improve my coding skills on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and its APIs and libraries such as Node.js, and Express.js. 
            I am glad to find that my passion on planning, solving issues and creating something meaningful helps me a lot in this field. 
            I am also very willing to learn new libraries and languages so that I will be able to create something which I can't do so with my current skills.<br><br> 
            
            I am looking forward to working with people from different backgrounds, solving problems/issues together and creating something meaningful for a better future!
